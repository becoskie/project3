After Class

Checkout this awesome app for meeting up after class to continue your learning!
Login to post your project ideas and to vote on which project you want to work on.



With our Boot Camp winding down and future employment on the horizon, we decided to create an app that would provide us with a place to continue our education and coding practice with fellow classmates and those wishing to grow their skills
After Class provides that opportunity for users to login and pick the projects or courses that they would like to be involved with.  The user will also be able to vote on a project that they are interested in building with fellow collaborators
The group will schedule ongoing practice lessons to enhance their knowledge base in areas such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, etc
Project meet up locations will be based on group attendee suggestions. 



Group members were: Justin Trieschmann, Hassan Lakis, Ray Becoskie, Abdullahi Abdirashid, and Randall Olson
